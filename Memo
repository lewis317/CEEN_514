	This semester, I hope to learn how to create web apps. I have had some exposure to certain Tethys apps through my capstone project, and I would like to better understand how to use them. Just in the first few days of class, I can tell that web apps open up a number of possibilities for different engineering solutions, and itâ€™s a valuable skill to learn. I would also love to learn more about different coding languages and how to use them.

	Our project attempts to map the possible snow melt across water basins. This would allow users to estimate how much runoff could possibly exist due to snow melt. Users could ideally see which rivers could flood, and which roads may be unusable within certain areas.
